# KidneyHealthAI 🧠💊
**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Visualization on Kidney Disease Dataset**

## 📄 Overview
**KidneyHealthAI** is a data-driven project focused on analyzing kidney disease datasets to uncover patterns and insights related to chronic kidney disease (CKD).  
Through Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), this project visualizes relationships among clinical parameters, helping identify key risk factors that contribute to kidney disorders.

## 🧰 Tech Stack
- **Python**
- **Pandas**, **NumPy**
- **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn**
- **Jupyter Notebook**

## 🔍 Key Objectives
1. Perform data cleaning and handle missing or inconsistent values.  
2. Conduct statistical exploration to understand distributions and patterns.  
3. Visualize relationships between medical indicators (e.g., blood pressure, glucose, hemoglobin).  
4. Identify correlations and potential predictors of chronic kidney disease.  

## 📊 Insights & Findings
- High blood pressure, anemia, and low hemoglobin levels correlate strongly with CKD presence.  
- Visualizations reveal class imbalance between CKD and non-CKD samples.  
- Correlation heatmaps and pair plots highlight significant variable relationships.  

## 📈 Visualizations
- **Heatmaps** — correlation between features  
- **Boxplots & Histograms** — feature distribution  
- **Count plots & Pair plots** — categorical and numerical comparisons  

## 🚀 Future Enhancements
- Integrate a **machine learning model** for disease prediction.  
- Build a **Streamlit dashboard** for interactive health analytics.  
- Combine with **real-world patient datasets** for broader applicability.
